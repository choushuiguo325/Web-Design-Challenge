# Web-Design-Challenge

A visualizition dashbord website of anaysis of the weather variables of cities around the world is created. 
After this dashboard is built, we've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

## A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image can take the user to that visualization.

## Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

## Four correlation pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/correlation itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

## A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

## A "Data" page that:

All the pages are responsive to screen size and use a navbar to allow navigations between pages.
